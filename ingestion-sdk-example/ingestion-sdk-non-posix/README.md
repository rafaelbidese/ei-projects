# Edge Impulse C Ingestion SDK

The C Ingestion SDK is a portable header-only library written in C99 for data collection on embedded devices. It's designed to reliably store sampled data from sensors at a high frequency in very little memory. On top of this it allows cryptographic signing of the data when sampling is complete. Data can be stored on a POSIX file system, in memory, or on a raw block device.
